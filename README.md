# FabricItemMod
This is my so-called 'hello world' into the Minecraft fabric modding scene. This mod is meant to be used on Minecraft 1.16.4.
If you feel like adding suggestions for me to learn how to make, please leave a comment.
Please make sure to look at the issues page to see the crafting recipe.
If you just want to install the jar file, go to the 'jar files' dir and download the latest release.
Side note if you right click the item it will make a noise :)
